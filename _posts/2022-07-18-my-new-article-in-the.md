I’m excited to share that my new piece, “[Digital humanities needs equality between humanists and technicians](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/digital-humanities-needs-equality-between-humanists-and-technicians)“, has been published in *Times Higher Education*. It is about labour issues and recognition that are becoming increasingly salient in digital humanities labs. As I argue, introducing a fair publication policy, such [as the one recently published by King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/governancezone/research/fair-publication-policy), is a step towards assuring that the work performed by research technicians and technology and skills specialists is acknowledged in research outputs. Recognition of contribution is a prerequisite for research production. Check it out [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/digital-humanities-needs-equality-between-humanists-and-technicians).
