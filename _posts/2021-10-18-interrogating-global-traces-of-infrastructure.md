I’m pleased to announce the second workshop in the Digital Humanities &amp; Critical Infrastructure Studies Workshop Series, “Interrogating Global Traces of Infrastructure”. The event is organised by [**King’s Digital Lab**](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/), King’s College [**Department of Digital Humanities**](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh), and Critical Infrastructures Studies Initiative ([**cistudies.org**](https://cistudies.org/)). The workshop brings together leading thinkers in Digital Humanities, Social Sciences, Digital Media, and Information Studies to discuss practices of investigating global topographies of knowledge, data, and IT infrastructures and their influence on local social, economic, and research conditions.
