**About the project**

DH Infra (#DHInfra) is a research blog related to the ongoing Marie Skłodowska-Curie project, “Digital Humanities Laboratory: Studying the Entanglement of Infrastructure and Technology in Knowledge Production” by Dr Urszula Pawlicka-Deger.

The project aims to provide a critical analysis of digital humanities working practices in a laboratory environment and infrastructural influences on knowledge production. The study is drawn on a novel empirical investigation of laboratory practices in digital humanities by merging various ethnographic methods: a laboratory ethnography developed in science and technology studies, the ethnography of infrastructure in sociology and information studies, and digital ethnography in the anthropology. The integrative methodology approach aims to build a new toolset for studying the intertwining of human organisation, infrastructure, and knowledge. This research also intends to propose a humanities-centred analysis of infrastructure, which has the potential to reveal technical, socio-political, and cultural complexities entangled in local and global contexts.

The research is based on case studies of the UK digital humanities labs with a central focus on [King’s Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk), participatory observation, interviews, and analysis of written documents. As part of this research, Dr Pawlicka-Deger will organise seminars and workshops, present her outcomes at international conferences, and publish scholarly articles, methodological guidance, and monograph.
